# div-canvas
Small demo showing drawing capabilities with just &lt;div> elements<br>
Each &lt;div> element is 1px x 1px and represents pixels. As of now we can draw lines and points on the "canvas".<br>
Starts the canvas cursor at (0,0) then click to draw a line to the new cursor point. Painfully slow.
